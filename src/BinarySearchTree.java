 *	BinarySearchTree interface
 *	
 *	Encapsulates the basic functionality of an ordered tree in which each node
 *	of the tree can have a maximum of 2 child nodes, and the items in the tree
 *	are stored according to the following ordering rule:
 *		1)	items < a given item, X, will be located in X's left subtree
 *		2)	items > a given item, X, will be located in X's right subtree
 *		3)	duplicate items are not allowed
