 *	interface Map
 *
 *	Encapsulates the basic functionality for a data structure which maps items
 *	to keys.  An item can only be added, removed, or retrieved via its key.
 *
 *	Duplicate items are allowed in a Map, but duplicate keys are not allowed.
 *
 *	This interface does not provide iterators; rather, the keys or values in the
 *	Map can be returned in the form of a List, which can be traversed.
