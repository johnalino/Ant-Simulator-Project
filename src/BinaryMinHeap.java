 *	class BinaryMinHeap
 *
 *	Implementation of a binary min heap.  Access to items is restricted to the
 *	item with the minimum value.  Whenever an item is added or removed, it is
 *	guaranteed that upon completion of the operation the items will be ordered
 *	such that the next item that can be retrieved or removed will be the item
 *	that has the minimum value.  Comparisons are done via the compareTo method.
 *
 *	Items are positioned such that when the heap is represented as a complete
 *	binary tree, for any given node, X, in the tree:
 *		1)	the item in X is <= the item in X's left child
 *		2)	the item in X is <= the item in X's right child
 *
 *	When the heap is represented as an array, A, for any item in array index, i,
 *	where i != 0:
 *		1)	the item in A[i] is <= the item in A[i * 2]
 *		2)	the item in A[i] is <= the item in A[i * 2 + 1]
